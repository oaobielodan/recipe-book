# recipe-book

**Background:**

My goal with this project was to create a virtual recipe book where I can store all the recipes I collect online, particularly from social media. Typically, I save these recipes in a folder 
within the app I’m using, but this method has several drawbacks. It’s not easy to access or organize the recipes, and I often forget what I’ve saved. Additionally, many of these videos don’t 
include a written recipe, and so I am required me to watch and listen through the entire video to gather all the necessary details. I would also have to rewatch the video if I forgot something.
To solve this, I wanted a dedicated space where I could store these recipes in an easily accessible format. My goal was for the book to be both searchable and to include an appendix that 
lists all the recipes alphabetically. From the appendix, users can click on any recipe to navigate directly to its page.

I also wanted the virtual book to replicate the experience of a physical book, complete with page-flipping animations. Designing the book’s layout and structure was relatively straightforward, 
but I ran into challenges when implementing the page-turning effect. I followed this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgYNB6sdF5Q), but the animation didn’t work as expected. The pages 
flipped incorrectly, the right page wasn’t displaying the background color, and key information wasn’t appearing properly. For now, I pivoted to a simpler design where users can navigate through 
the appendix to access any recipe. While this approach maintains the book’s functionality, I still plan to refine the page-flipping animation in the future.

**Note:** 

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the in-progress flipping-animated recipe book is in the "book stuff" folder.
